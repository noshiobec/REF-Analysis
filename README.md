## Executive Summary:

<p style="text-align: justify;">The Research Excellence Framework (REF) serves as a critical evaluation system for assessing research quality across higher education institutions in the UK. This report presents an analysis conducted using a subset of the REF dataset in Power BI. Key findings and insights derived from the analysis provide a foundation for strategic decision-making in higher education institutions. The interactive nature of the analysis ensures accessibility on both desktop and mobile devices, facilitating deeper exploration for stakeholders.</p>

## Introduction:

<p style="text-align: justify;">The Research Excellence Framework (REF) is a pivotal mechanism guiding funding allocation, collaboration, and research enhancement across higher education institutions in the UK. This report presents an analysis conducted using a subset of the REF dataset in Power BI, focusing on key metrics related to research quality, income sources, and doctorates awarded.</p>

## Data Collection and Preparation:

<p style="text-align:justify;">The subset of the REF dataset was acquired and processed through meticulous data cleaning and transformation using Python code. Data modeling involved designing relationships between relevant tables and creating calculated columns and measures to ensure accuracy and consistency in analysis.</p>

## Visualization Design:

<p style="text-align:justify;">Visualizations were carefully selected based on the nature of the data to provide an intuitive layout for a user-friendly experience. Features such as slicers for interactive filtering and a mobile view were incorporated to enhance accessibility across devices.</p>

## Key Metrics Analysis:

Institutions Total: [Explanation of total number of institutions included in the dataset.]
Units of Assessment Total: [Explanation of total number of units of assessment.]
Total Income Sources: [Overview of sources contributing to total income.]
Income Total: [Analysis of total income generated across institutions.]
Total Doctorates Awarded: [Explanation of total number of doctorates awarded.]
Income Analysis: [Identification of institutions contributing significantly to overall income and those with minimal contribution.]
Doctorates Analysis: [Identification of trends in doctorates awarded and their distribution across institutions and units of assessment.]
Result Analysis: [Distribution of star ratings across research profile categories.]
Others: [Highlighting proportion of staff members in each academic discipline.]

## Insights:
